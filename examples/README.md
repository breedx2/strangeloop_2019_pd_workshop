The examples in this directory are intended to show some very VERY brief examples
of some simple yet interesting things that can be built with pd.

These examples depend on abstractions from 
[my pure-data github repo](https://github.com/breedx2/pure-data)
but copied (duplicated) into each example directory for simplicity.

# example 1 - brooder

A brooding noise that grows and insects from rumbles.

# example 2 - sequencer thing

A pretty good jam (tbd)
